# Examples for using skulpt in web pages

These examples are my first attempts in using Skulpt in web pages.
I took the examples from [skulpt.org](http://www.skulpt.org) and tried to split them up.

As development goes on, the examples use newer versions of skulpt base libraries,
the latest ones are from [skulpt-dist/releases](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt-dist/releases)

Currently I have HTML files for the "plain editor" (skulpt.html) and the interactive shell (skinteractive.html). They need and reference the files in the directory static, so downloading this rep should work fine.

Feel free to explore and respect the [licenses](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt/blob/master/LICENSE) from Skulpt and related work

20.10.2016: Edit a different editor, skulpt_editor. It adds html form elements to load local python scripts, save a script to a local file and adds a button to clear the editor "window".
